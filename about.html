                    <h2>Our Roots</h2>
                    <p>Established in 2010, Green Haven Nursery began as a small family-run operation in the rolling hills of the countryside. With over a decade of experience, we’ve grown into a trusted name in plant cultivation and landscape design. Our dedication to quality seedlings and expert plantation services has helped thousands of customers transform their spaces into thriving green oases.</p>
                    <p>We take pride in our sustainable practices—using organic compost and rainwater harvesting to nurture over 50 species of native plants. Fun fact: Did you know that gardening can reduce stress by up to 30%, according to a study from the University of Michigan? We’re here to make that a reality for you!</p>

                    <h2>A Blooming History</h2>
                    <p>Our journey started with a simple love for plants. Founders Jane and Michael Green turned their backyard hobby into a thriving business after noticing a demand for locally grown, hardy plants. By 2015, we expanded to a 10-acre nursery, complete with greenhouses and a dedicated propagation area. Today, we supply plants to both residential gardeners and commercial landscapers across the region.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by the RHS (Royal Horticultural Society), we’ve adopted techniques like companion planting—pairing marigolds with vegetables to naturally deter pests. This has made our seedlings some of the healthiest you’ll find!</p>

                <div class="text-left">
                    <p>Our team is a blend of horticulturists, landscape designers, and plant enthusiasts. With certifications from the American Nursery & Landscape Association, our staff brings expertise to every project. Jane, our head grower, has 20 years of experience in plant propagation, while Michael oversees our eco-friendly initiatives—like our zero-waste pot recycling program.</p>
                    <p>We also partner with local schools, teaching kids about the wonders of photosynthesis (plants convert sunlight into energy—what a superpower!). Last year, we hosted over 200 students for hands-on planting workshops.</p>

                    <h2>Our Values</h2>
                    <p>At Green Haven, sustainability isn’t just a buzzword—it’s our core. We’ve reduced our carbon footprint by 40% since 2018 by switching to solar-powered greenhouses. Plants like our lavender fields don’t just look pretty—they attract pollinators like bees, which produce 70% of the world’s crops, according to the USDA.</p>
                    <p>We believe everyone deserves a green space. That’s why we donate 5% of our profits to community garden projects, helping urban areas bloom. Join us in growing a greener tomorrow!</p>
